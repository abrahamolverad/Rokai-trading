# Trading AI Platform Requirements Research

## Key Components of AI Trading Platforms

### AI Algorithms and Models
1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Used for predicting stock prices or identifying trends
   - Requires labeled datasets with historical data and outcomes
   - Good for price prediction and pattern recognition

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Used for clustering and anomaly detection
   - Works with unlabeled datasets to identify patterns
   - Useful for market segmentation and unusual market behavior detection

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Used for optimizing trading strategies
   - Based on rewards and punishments to maximize returns
   - Particularly effective for algorithmic trading strategy development

4. **Machine Learning Algorithms**
   - Analyze vast amounts of data to identify trends and patterns
   - Make predictions about future market movements
   - Help traders make more informed decisions

5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - Analyze unstructured data like news articles and social media
   - Gain insights into market sentiment and trends
   - Process text-based information that impacts markets

6. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Use statistical modeling and machine learning techniques
   - Make predictions about future market movements
   - Identify patterns and trends in historical data

7. **High-Frequency Trading Algorithms**
   - Execute trades at extremely high speeds
   - Take advantage of small price movements and discrepancies
   - Rely on complex mathematical models and advanced computing power

8. **Automated Decision-Making**
   - Automate processes like report creation and trading execution
   - Free up traders to focus on high-level tasks
   - Reduce human error in repetitive tasks

### Infrastructure Models
1. **Client-Server Model**
   - AI algorithms and data hosted on central server
   - Accessed by users through client applications (web/mobile)
   - Allows for easy scaling and handling large volumes of data
   - Potential security vulnerabilities if server not properly secured

2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model**
   - Users connect directly with each other to trade
   - Share AI-generated insights without central server
   - More efficient resource utilization and better privacy
   - Less stable and reliable compared to centralized platforms

3. **Hybrid Model**
   - Combines elements of client-server and P2P models
   - Central server facilitates trades and provides AI access
   - Users can connect directly to complete trades
   - Provides benefits of both models while minimizing drawbacks

4. **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)**
   - Decentralized, transparent, and secure record-keeping
   - Often used with blockchain technology
   - Ensures integrity and security of AI-generated insights
   - Immutable transaction records

### Essential Features
1. **Order Execution Capabilities**
   - Fast and reliable order processing
   - Critical for getting the best prices in fast-moving markets
   - High-frequency trading platforms execute in microseconds
   - Smart order routing to find best deals across exchanges

2. **Dashboard with Statistical Information**
   - Real-time data from multiple sources
   - Charts, price updates, and exchange rates
   - Clear presentation of actionable financial data
   - Helps traders make informed decisions without delay

3. **Authentication**
   - Multi-factor authentication (SMS, Google Authenticator)
   - Different access levels for users
   - Protects user accounts and builds trust
   - Ensures only authorized traders access sensitive data

4. **CRM and Admin Functionality**
   - Manage customer requests efficiently
   - Handle trading operations
   - Check account permissions
   - Smooth and intuitive admin interface

5. **Fast Searching and Filtering Tools**
   - Quick access to specific data (rates, orders, commodities)
   - Real-time filtering of results
   - Speeds up decision-making process
   - Enables traders to act on opportunities before they disappear

6. **Alerts**
   - Timely updates on market changes
   - Custom notifications for specific conditions
   - Keeps traders informed of important events

### Risks and Limitations
1. **Bias**
   - AI algorithms reflect biases in training data
   - Need diverse, representative data to avoid biased results

2. **Accuracy**
   - AI algorithms aren't perfect
   - Regular testing and validation required
   - Need to ensure reliable predictions

3. **Regulation**
   - Evolving regulatory landscape
   - Varies by region (US: SEC, FINRA; Australia: AFSL)
   - Compliance builds investor trust

4. **Limited Understanding**
   - AI lacks human reasoning abilities
   - May struggle with complex, nuanced decisions
   - Requires human oversight and intervention

5. **Dependence**
   - Traders may become over-reliant on AI
   - Risk of losing ability to make independent decisions
   - Need balance between AI tools and human expertise
